                    <h2>The special messenger of Daoism<br> Culture in China</h2>
                    <p>In the time before Daoism was formed, tea was already inextricably connected with Daoist thoughts. Both Daoism and tea share the same essence, the unity of man and nature, which is also the fundamental objective of Kite Tea. <br>
Applying to modern life, the fast-paced environment often pushes stresses on you, who desire a balance between tension and relaxation. Kite Tea shows up and provides you the time to enjoy a cup of time with a peaceful heart, to relax the body in the intervals of heavy works. </p>

            <div class="con_div ousStory_div4">Kite Tea brings you the remarkable aroma and flavor, as well as a peaceful mind to taste that flavor. Nevertheless, this balance indicates the Daoistic idea of the unity of man and nature--that to relax your heart and mind to feel the nature. </div>
